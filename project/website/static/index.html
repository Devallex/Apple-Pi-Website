			<h1>Who we Are</h1>
			<p>
				Located in the town of Guilford, CT and surrounding communities, Apple Pi Robotics is an <abbr
					title="First Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr> team with
				the
				goal of bringing real-world experience in <abbr
					title="Science, Technology, Engineering and Math">STEM</abbr> to high school students. They are
				aided by our team
				mentors,
				who come from a wide background of engineering experience. Still, participating in the team is not all
				about
				building robots. There are opportunities in managing the business as an <abbr
					title="Non-Profit Organization">NPO</abbr>, and we also take pride in
				helping to build our community through frequent events and fundraisers. <br><br><b><a
