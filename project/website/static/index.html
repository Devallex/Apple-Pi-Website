		<h1>Who we Are</h1>
		<p>
			Located in the town of Guilford, CT and surrounding communities, Apple Pi Robotics is an <abbr title="First Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr> team with the goal of bringing real-world experience in <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math">STEM</abbr> to high school students.
			They are aided by our team mentors, who come from a wide background of engineering experience.

			Still, participating in the team is not all about building robots.
			There are opportunities in managing the business as an <abbr title="Non-Profit Organization">NPO</abbr>,
			and we also take pride in helping to build our community through frequent events and fundraisers.
