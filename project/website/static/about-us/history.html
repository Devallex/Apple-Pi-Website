			In October of 2006, Apple Pi FIRST Robotics Team 2067 was born,
			providing Guilford High School students with the opportunity to enrich
			their education within a motivating and challenging environment. The
			program’s founder Al Bishop was inspired while attending his grandson’s
			robotics competitions in New Hampshire. Upon witnessing the competition
			and the exciting atmosphere it created, he was compelled to introduce
			Guilford to the FIRST Robotics program. He approached the metal shop
			teacher at Guilford High School, and over the next few days, they
			collaborated on creating and organizing a team. Fliers and announcements
			were produced and a successful first meeting followed. The group
			expanded dramatically over the course of the next few meetings with the
			addition of new members as interest grew.

			Over the next several weeks several key sponsors were developed which
			included Bishop’s Orchards, NASA and Page Hardware and a grant was also
			obtained from the Guilford Fund for Education (GFFE) all which helped
			get the program off the ground. Additional sponsors have been added over
			the years ranging from multi-national Fortune 500 companies to local
			Guilford based businesses that care deeply about our community.

			During its first year, the team received the prestigious Rookie All Star
			award at Connecticut’s Hartford Regional, which enabled us to attend
			Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia while in our first competition season.
			Apple Pi Robotics returned to the Atlanta championships during the 2009
			and 2010 seasons and has been a constant attendee of the Hartford
			Regional and has also attended the Granite State Regional and Worcester
			Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Regional. The “Where is Wolcott” and “Bash
			at the Beach” invitationals make up our off-season schedule.

			Apple Pi alumni have gone on to study at excellent colleges and
			universities, including Carnegie-Melon, Yale, Brown, WPI, Virginia Tech,
			Syracuse University, Georgia Tech, University of Rochester and others.
			These graduates are majoring in subjects such biomedical and mechanical
			engineering, biophysics, robotics engineering and architecture. Others
			have applied the skills and experience they gained from FIRST and are
			utilizing them to succeed in other non-technical educational pursuits.
			All of these robotics graduates share a common drive to use teamwork,
			problem-solving skills, and innovative solutions to make a positive
			impact on their community.
