			<h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Apple Pi is a group of high school students from Guilford and surrounding communities working to make
				the
				“connection” between the academic lessons of a high school curriculum and the world of an
				engineering-based
				business. Opportunities exist to take part in all aspects of the business – planning, financing,
				marketing,
				design and the building of a robot intended to compete against other robots in a game that changes every
				year. Students are presented with the real-world challenges dealing with time, budget and resource
				constraints.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apple Pi is also a group of mentors from the local community who work in engineering, science, business
				management and many other disciplines within their respective companies. These mentors provide guidance
				and
				perspective as the students embark on their journey
