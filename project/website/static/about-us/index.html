		<h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
		<p>
			Apple Pi is a group of high school students from Guilford and surrounding communities working to make the
			“connection” between the academic lessons of a high school curriculum and the world of an engineering-based
			business. Opportunities exist to take part in all aspects of the business – planning, financing, marketing,
			design and the building of a robot intended to compete against other robots in a game that changes every
			year. Students are presented with the real-world challenges dealing with time, budget and resource
			constraints.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apple Pi is also a group of mentors from the local community who work in engineering, science, business
			management and many other disciplines within their respective companies. These mentors provide guidance and
			perspective as the students embark on their journey
