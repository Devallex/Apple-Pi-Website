		<h2>Our Community Goal</h2>
		<p>
			FIRST, although generally recognized as a robotics program, is much more
			than that. The building of a robot is only one way FIRST achieves its
			central goal of inspiring student participation in science and
			technology. Community activism is encouraged by the FIRST organization.
			To this end, Apple Pi Robotics makes a point of giving back to our
			community.
		</p>

		<h2>Chick Day 2011</h2>
		<p>
			Apple Pi’s community service programs embrace our agricultural roots
			while promoting science, math and engineering disciplines; doing
			robotics demonstrations at 4H fairs, Guilford town fairs, Chick Days at
			a local feed supply store, and donkey and pony shows at Bishops Orchard
			keep us in touch with the community that supports our team. We also make
			a point of making an impact on younger children, which is arguably the
			core of FIRST, by demonstrating our robot to local Brownie Troops, the
			Melissa Jones after school program, and by starting our very own FIRST
			Lego League team in 2011.
		</p>

		<h2>BBQ Pit Menu</h2>
		<p>
			We have done free car washes for the elderly and hosted Cruise Nights,
			where our robot delivers the barbecue pit “menu for the evening” to
			members of the community who gather to display their classic cars. These
			summer events have become very popular in the town over the last few
			years and provide a great venue for Apple Pi to promote our
			organization, its’ values and also aids in the recruitment process for
			new members.
		</p>

		<h2>Fundraising</h2>
		<p>
			In 2011, we undertook a very worthwhile project that has special meaning
			to our organization. The founder of Apple Pi Robotics, Al Bishop,
			offered to make a very generous donation to the Institute for
			neuro-degenerative Disorders. He asked that as a team we find a way to
			raise the funds and match his donation. We are pleased to report that we
			not only met, but exceeded the challenge, ultimately making a donation
			of $1000 dollars to the institute.
		</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Overall, FIRST is about the community. A good team will do well in
			competition, but a great team will do well in competition while also
			spreading the message of FIRST through community activities.
